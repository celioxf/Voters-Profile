I created this project to help me present some concepts I use on my master thesis. I'm writing about microtargeting in an electoral context, so to help me clarify how 
politicians divide their voters in groups to draw conclusions on how to organise campaigns, I decided to analyse this dataset from 2016, which contains the results of a survey 
made by [voters study group](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/). The survey collected data on the location, the values and expectations of voters across all the United States.

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/data) as well as guides to better understand the data.
